# 🧾 Insurance and Policy Analysis Dashboards 



---

## 🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a set of *interactive dashboards* to analyze insurance branch performance, customer policies, and claim activities.  
These dashboards help management and analysts track *key performance indicators (KPIs)* related to *sales opportunities, renewals, customer demographics, policy growth, and claim trends*.

---

## 📊 About the Dashboards
This project includes two major dashboards:
1. *Insurance Branch Dashboard*
2. *Policy Analysis Dashboard*

Each dashboard provides visual insights into operational efficiency, financial achievements, and customer metrics using real-time data visualization and performance KPIs.

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 🔹 Insurance Branch Dashboard
- *Total Opportunities* – Number of all business opportunities.  
- *Open Opportunities* – Opportunities still under process.  
- *Average Claim Speed* – Average time taken to process a claim.  
- *Yearly Meetings* – Count of meetings held by the branch team.  
- *Cross Sell / New / Renewal Achievements* – Achieved, invoice, and target comparison.  
- *Meeting by Executive* – Performance visualization by individual executives.  
- *Stage of Revenue* – Breakdown of revenue by negotiation or proposal stage.  
- *Opportunity Product Distribution* – Distribution by specialty (Employee Benefits, Property/BI, Marine, Construction, etc.).

### 🔹 Policy Analysis Dashboard
- *Count of Customer ID* – Total number of customers analyzed.  
- *Claim-wise Policy Count* – Breakdown by Approved, Pending, and Denied claims.  
- *Total Policies* – Segregated as Active, Terminated, or Lapsed.  
- *Policy Type Count* – Classification by Health, Property, Life, and Auto.  
- *Payment Status* – Successful vs Failed transactions.  
- *Premium Growth Rate (%)* – Trend of yearly premium growth.  
- *Policies Expiring Current Year* – Monthly distribution of expiring policies.  
- *Gender-wise Policy Count* – Comparison among Male, Female, and Other.

## 📚 Project Insights
- The *Renewal segment* achieved over *150%* of its target, outperforming other areas.  
- *Cross-sell opportunities* show moderate success but require better conversion strategies.  
- *Majority of policies* belong to *Health and Property* segments.  
- *Claim approval rate* is high, but pending claims indicate operational bottlenecks.  
- *Premium growth rate* shows a stable upward trend, reflecting consistent policy retention.
